<h1>CHOCOLATES</h1>

<p>MUNCH:Crunchy wafer biscuit covered in decadent chocolate, yum! Nestle Munch is enjoyed by people across age groups. Munch was one of the first Nestle products that were launched only for the Indian market in 1999.

In 2015, Nestle launched over 40 new products. Among these, the Nestle Munch Crunch o Nuts and Nestle Munch Nuts were marketed as nutty variants of the classic wafer chocolate bar. 

In our Nestle Munch chocolates review, we discuss the taste, textures, price, packaging, and major differences between the new and old Nestle Munch chocolates.</p>
<p>PERK:The new launched perk with glucose is a complete no no to have, the quality of chocolate is degraded as well as the taste by adding glucose. The original perk chocolate was much better and good quality as well as quantity. Would love to have the original one back in market</p>
<p>BOUNTY:Bounty is a coconut-filled, chocolate-enrobed candy bar manufactured by Mars, Incorporated, introduced in 1951 in the United Kingdom and Canada. It is a direct emulation of the Mounds bar introduced by Peter Paul in 1936, and also copies the milk chocolate enrobing of Hershey's Almond Joy, introduced in 1948. It is no longer being sold in the United States.</p>
